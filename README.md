Give your visitors a theme they like to use, and they will stay on
your site much longer.

Add a web plugin to toggle through multiple themes.  In a click or
a tap on a keyboard,  user can switch between themes by clicking a
button or using the keyboard shortcut `Ctrl + Alt + T`.

Programmatically execute `theme.change()` or `theme.set()`
to create a variety of options for your visitors.

User preferences are stored locally. It will stay through refresh,
closing or reloading of the page.

This plugin is coded fresh and compiled to ECMAScript 6 (ES6) 2015
Standard,  without any dependency to other scripts. The plugin are
kept neatly within scope and easily accessible using an interface.
